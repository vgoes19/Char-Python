<img src="https://github.com/vgoes19/Chat-Python-Local/blob/main/images/comunicacao.jpg"/>


First we call the file 'servidor.py' so we can start listening to the connections.
Then run the client files by placing a user name and text entries in the chat.

The connection address that the application is being placed as local ip, but we can declare any address for data exchange.
The threadding modules and socket are used where the socket run several tasks in the same process and threading is used for the communication.

For writing, the art module is used, calling a tprint with any text.
